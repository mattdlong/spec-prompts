# Yoga Schedule Manager - Project Documentation

This repository contains the comprehensive documentation for the Yoga Schedule Manager application. It follows a structured approach to software specification, from vision statement to implementation details.

## Overview

The Yoga Schedule Manager will help yoga studios and independent teachers manage their class schedules, student registrations, and business operations. This documentation repository:

1. Breaking down the development process into logical documentation steps
2. Ensuring each document builds on previous ones for consistency
3. Maintaining traceability from business requirements to technical implementation
4. Providing clear specifications for all aspects of the application
5. Organizing implementation into sequential sprints and detailed tickets

## Document Flow

The prompts should be executed in the following order to ensure proper dependencies are maintained:

## Usage Instructions

### Documentation Phase

1. **Create the `/specifications` directory** in your project root (if it doesn't exist already)
   ```
   mkdir -p specifications
   ```

2. **Initialize the documentation progress tracking file**
   ```
   touch progress.md
   ```

3. **Follow the document flow** outlined above, starting with the Vision Statement and proceeding in order

4. **For each documentation prompt**:
   - Review the prompt file to understand its requirements
   - Gather the required user input
   - Generate the document using the prompt
   - Save the output to the `/specifications` directory with the appropriate filename
   - Update the progress.md file

### Development Standards Phase

1. **Create development standards documents** after completing the system architecture
   - Use the microservice-rules-prompt.md to create microservice development standards
   - Use the frontend-rules-prompt.md to create frontend development standards
   
2. **For each standards document**:
   - Reference the appropriate specification documents (System Architecture, Technical Requirements, etc.)
   - Ensure standards align with architectural decisions
   - Create concrete examples of proper implementation
   - Save the output to the `/specifications` directory with the appropriate filename
   - Update the progress.md file

### Implementation Planning Phase

1. **Create the `/sprints` directory** in your project root
   ```
   mkdir -p sprints
   ```

2. **Initialize the implementation progress tracking file**
   ```
   touch sprints/progress.md
   ```

3. **Create sprint planning document** using the sprint-planning-prompt.md
   - Review all specification documents
   - Identify logical development phases
   - Define sprint objectives and timeframes

4. **Create sprint subdirectories** for each planned sprint
   ```
   mkdir -p sprints/sprint_01
   mkdir -p sprints/sprint_02
   # etc.
   ```

5. **Create implementation tickets** in each sprint directory
   - Use the ticket-template.md as a guide
   - Follow the naming convention: ticket_sprint01_ticket01.md
   - Ensure dependencies between tickets are clearly documented
   - Reference relevant specification documents

6. **Maintain the implementation progress tracking file** (sprints/progress.md)
   - Update after each sprint
   - Track completed features
   - Document architectural decisions
   - Note blockers and risks

## Maintaining Progress Files

### Documentation Progress (progress.md)

The documentation progress file helps you track your specification document creation. Update it after completing each document with the following information:

1. Check the box for the completed document
2. Add the completion date
3. Update the "Current Status" section
4. Update the "Next Steps" section
5. Add any relevant notes or decisions made

### Implementation Progress (sprints/progress.md)

The implementation progress file tracks the actual development of the project. Update it after each sprint with:

1. Update the "Sprint Status" section with completed sprints and achievements
2. Update the "Current Sprint" section with objectives and progress
3. Document completed features with references to specification documents
4. Track current work with ticket IDs and statuses
5. Note any blockers, risks, or architectural decisions
6. Update implementation metrics (velocity, test coverage, etc.)
7. Capture retrospective insights for continuous improvement

## Notes

- All documents are generated in Markdown format
- Each document builds upon previous ones, so maintain the recommended sequence
- Store all generated documents in the `/specifications` directory for proper cross-referencing
- The prompts are designed to work with the Claude AI assistant

## Example Workflow

### Documentation Workflow

1. Start by reviewing the vision-statement-prompt.md
2. Provide the required inputs for your Vision Statement
3. Generate the Vision.md document and save it to /specifications/
4. Update progress.md to mark Vision Statement as complete
5. Proceed to the BRD prompt, referring to your completed Vision Statement
6. Continue through each document in sequence until you have a complete set of specification documents

### Implementation Planning Workflow

1. After completing all specification documents, use the sprint-planning-prompt.md to create a sprint plan
2. Break down the project into logical sprints based on dependencies and complexity
3. Create sprint folders and individual implementation tickets for each sprint
4. For each ticket:
   - Include clear references to specification documents
   - Define acceptance criteria based on specs
   - Document dependencies on other tickets
5. Begin implementation tracking as development starts
6. Update the sprints/progress.md file after each sprint

By following this structured approach, you'll create a comprehensive set of software specification documents and a well-organized implementation plan that maintains consistency and traceability throughout your project's lifecycle.
