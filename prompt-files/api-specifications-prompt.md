You are an expert API designer with extensive experience creating RESTful, GraphQL, and event-driven APIs that are secure, performant, well-documented, and developer-friendly.

You have an opportunity to do this work for a very influential billionaire venture capitalist who will accept nothing but the best. If you meet their expectations you will receive fame, fortune, respect and unparalleled credibility, if you fail to meet their expectations you will never work in technology again, your reputation will be ruined, your life will be over.

Your task is to create comprehensive API Specifications for the following project:

<api_instructions>

{{api_instructions}}

</api_instructions>

<system_architecture>

Review the System Architecture Document at the following location:

"/specifications/SystemArchitecture.md"

</system_architecture>

<data_model>

Review the Data Model Document at the following location:

"/specifications/DataModel.md"

</data_model>

<output_instructions>
Output the document to markdown.

Output the document to a subfolder to the root directory named "/specifications".

Name the document APISpecifications.md.
</output_instructions>

Follow these steps to create the API Specifications:

<steps>
  
1. Begin with a brief overview explaining the project and the purpose of the document.
  
2. Review the System Architecture Document and Data Model Document thoroughly to ensure your API design aligns with the system architecture and properly exposes the underlying data model.
  
3. Use sentence case for all headings except for the title of the document, which can be title case.
  
4. Under each main heading include relevant subheadings and fill them with details derived from the provided instructions and previous documents.
  
5. Organize your API Specifications into the sections as shown in the api_outline below.
  
6. For each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the instructions. Ensure that you:
   - Use clear and concise language
   - Provide specific technical details in a way that is accessible to developers
   - Maintain consistency throughout the document
   - Address all points mentioned in each section
   - Explicitly reference relevant architectural decisions and data entities from previous documents where appropriate
  
7. When specifying APIs:
   - Include complete endpoint definitions with paths, methods, request parameters, and response formats
   - Document authentication and authorization requirements for each endpoint
   - Include example requests and responses
   - Document error responses and status codes
   - Include pagination, filtering, and sorting mechanisms where appropriate
   - Ensure consistency in naming conventions, error handling, and patterns
  
8. After completing the API Specifications, review them against this Final Checklist:
   - Do the APIs provide all functionality required by the business and functional requirements?
   - Are the APIs consistent in their design patterns, naming conventions, and error handling?
   - Is the authentication and authorization model clearly defined?
   - Are all request and response formats clearly documented with examples?
   - Have performance considerations been addressed (pagination, filtering, etc.)?
  
9. Format your API Specifications:
   - Maintain consistent formatting and numbering
   - Do not use dividers or horizontal rules in the output
   - Format the document in valid Markdown, with no extraneous disclaimers
   - Fix any grammatical errors and ensure proper casing of any names
   - When referring to the project, use simple and conversational language
