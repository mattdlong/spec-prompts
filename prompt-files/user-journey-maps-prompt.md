</output_instructions>

Follow these steps to create the User Journey Maps:

<steps>
  
1. Begin with a brief overview explaining the project and the purpose of the document.
  
2. Review the Vision Statement, Business Requirements Document, and especially the User Personas Document thoroughly to ensure your journey maps align with the project vision, business requirements, and accurately represent the experiences of the defined personas.
  
3. Use sentence case for all headings except for the title of the document, which can be title case.
  
4. Under each main heading include relevant subheadings and fill them with details derived from the provided instructions and previous documents.
  
5. Organize your User Journey Maps into the sections as shown in the journey_outline below.
  
6. For each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the instructions. Ensure that you:
   - Use clear and concise language
   - Provide specific details to make journey maps accurate and insightful
   - Maintain consistency throughout the document
   - Address all points mentioned in each section
   - Explicitly reference relevant personas from the User Personas Document
  
7. When creating journey maps:
   - Create separate journey maps for each primary persona
   - Focus on the most important scenarios or use cases for each persona
   - Include pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction phases
   - Map emotions throughout the journey to identify high and low points
   - Identify opportunities for improvement at pain points
   - Include relevant touchpoints, channels, and interactions
   - Highlight moments of truth and critical decision points
  
8. After completing the User Journey Maps, review them against this Final Checklist:
   - Do the journey maps align with the personas' goals, motivations, and pain points?
   - Are all critical touchpoints and interactions included?
   - Are emotional highs and lows clearly identified?
   - Are specific opportunities for improvement identified at pain points?
   - Does each journey map tell a coherent story of the user's experience?
  
9. Format your User Journey Maps document:
   - Maintain consistent formatting and numbering
   - Do not use dividers or horizontal rules in the output
   - Format the document in valid Markdown, with no extraneous disclaimers
   - Fix any grammatical errors and ensure proper casing of any names
   - When referring to the project, use simple and conversational language
   - Use markdown tables effectively to represent journey stages and touchpoints
