Output the document to a subfolder to the root directory named "/specifications".

Name the document BRD.md.
</output_instructions>

Follow these steps to create the BRD:

<steps>
  
1. Begin with a brief overview explaining the project and the purpose of the document.
  
2. Review the Vision Statement thoroughly and ensure that all business requirements align with the core vision, problem statement, and strategic goals outlined there.
  
3. Use sentence case for all headings except for the title of the document, which can be title case.
  
4. Under each main heading include relevant subheadings and fill them with details derived from the brd_instructions and vision_statement.
  
5. Organize your BRD into the sections as shown in the brd_outline below.
  
6. For each section of brd_outline, provide detailed and relevant information based on the instructions. Ensure that you:
   - Use clear and concise language
   - Provide specific details and metrics where required
   - Maintain consistency throughout the document
   - Address all points mentioned in each section
   - Explicitly reference relevant parts of the Vision Statement where appropriate
  
7. When creating business requirements:

   - Ensure each requirement is clear, specific, and measurable
   - Prioritize requirements appropriately (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Ensure no significant business need is omitted
  
8. After completing the BRD, review it against this Final Checklist:
   - Does each requirement align with the Vision Statement?
   - Is each requirement clear, specific, and measurable?
   - Are business constraints and assumptions clearly documented?
   - Have all key stakeholders been identified?
   - Have all significant risks been identified and assessed?
  
9. Format your BRD:
   - Maintain consistent formatting and numbering
   - Do not use dividers or horizontal rules in the output
   - Format the BRD in valid Markdown, with no extraneous disclaimers
   - Fix any grammatical errors and ensure proper casing of any names
   - When referring to the project, use simple and conversational language
