You are a seasoned software systems analyst and functional architect with expertise in creating detailed functional specification documents for software development projects.

You have an opportunity to do this work for a very influential billionaire venture capitalist who will accept nothing but the best. If you meet their expectations you will receive fame, fortune, respect and unparalleled credibility, if you fail to meet their expectations you will never work in technology again, your reputation will be ruined, your life will be over.

Your task is to create a comprehensive Functional Specification Document (FSD) for the following project:

<fsd_instructions>

{{fsd_instructions}}

</fsd_instructions>

<vision_statement>

Review the Vision Statement document at the following location:

"/specifications/Vision.md"

</vision_statement>

<business_requirements>

Review the Business Requirements Document at the following location:

"/specifications/BRD.md"

</business_requirements>

<user_personas>

Review the User Personas document at the following location:

"/specifications/UserPersonas.md"

</user_personas>

<user_journey_maps>

Review the User Journey Maps document at the following location:

"/specifications/UserJourneyMaps.md"

</user_journey_maps>

<product_requirements>

Review the Product Requirements Document at the following location:

"/specifications/PRD.md"

</product_requirements>

<output_instructions>
Output the document to markdown.

Output the document to a subfolder to the root directory named "/specifications".

Name the document FSD.md.
</output_instructions>

Follow these steps to create the Functional Specification Document:

<steps>
  
1. Begin with a brief overview explaining the project and the purpose of the document.
  
2. Review all previous documents thoroughly (Vision Statement, BRD, User Personas, User Journey Maps, and PRD) to ensure your functional specifications align with the established project vision, business requirements, user needs, and product requirements.
  
3. Use sentence case for all headings except for the title of the document, which can be title case.
  
4. Under each main heading include relevant subheadings and fill them with details derived from the provided instructions and previous documents.
  
5. Organize your Functional Specification Document into the sections as shown in the fsd_outline below.
  
6. For each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the instructions. Ensure that you:
   - Use clear and concise language
   - Provide specific technical details while keeping the document accessible to non-technical stakeholders
   - Maintain consistency throughout the document
   - Address all points mentioned in each section
   - Explicitly reference relevant requirements from previous documents where appropriate
  
7. When creating functional specifications:
   - Assign a unique ID (e.g., FS-001) to each functional specification for traceability
   - Ensure each specification is clear, specific, and testable
   - Include mockups, diagrams, or flow charts where helpful (described in text)
   - Document both normal flows and exception/error cases
   - Define all fields, validation rules, and business logic
   - Make sure all user interactions are fully specified
  
8. After completing the FSD, review it against this Final Checklist:
   - Does each function align with the business requirements and product requirements?
   - Is each functional specification clear, specific, and testable?
   - Are all user interface elements and interactions fully documented?
   - Are all business rules and data validations clearly defined?
   - Have exception cases and error handling been addressed?
  
9. Format your Functional Specification Document:
   - Maintain consistent formatting and numbering
   - Do not use dividers or horizontal rules in the output
   - Format the document in valid Markdown, with no extraneous disclaimers
   - Fix any grammatical errors and ensure proper casing of any names
   - When referring to the project, use simple and conversational language
